# weka-analysis

## What is this repository ?

This repository is an example of an analysis of the importance of J48 parameters when building a decision tree.

It was done for an assignment of the module **CO832: Data Mining** at the University Of Kent.

## Important files/folders

* The `datasets/input` folder contains the dataset used to train the decision tree

* The `run_all_trees.ipynb` file is the code used to run the tree with different parameters, and store the resutls.

* The `output` folder contains the files generated by `run_all_trees`, using weka `3.6`.

* The `analyze_weka_results.ipynb` file contains the code used for the analysis of the weka files.

* The `datasets/output` folder contains the results of the weka trees, stored as a csv dataset (one of them sorted by precision)

* Other python files provide some other analysis tools used to find interesting trees.
